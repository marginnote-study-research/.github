## About MarginNote
MarginNote is a comprehensive study and research application that redefines how users interact with documents and build knowledge. It combines reading, annotation, note-taking, and knowledge organization into a unified workflow, addressing the fragmented experience of using separate tools for reading, highlighting, and studying. The application allows users to actively engage with texts by extracting key concepts directly into structured notes and visual mind maps, creating connections between ideas from different documents and building a personal knowledge network. This integrated approach is particularly valuable for students, researchers, and lifelong learners who need to synthesize information from multiple sources and transform passive reading into active learning.

The application's power lies in its ability to connect different learning modalities. As users annotate PDFs or EPUBs, they can instantly create mind map nodes, outline entries, or flashcards from their highlights. These elements remain dynamically linked, so revisiting a highlight shows related mind map connections and study cards. The spaced repetition system uses algorithms to optimize review timing, while the outline view provides linear organization alongside the non-linear mind maps. For complex research projects, academic study, or professional development, MarginNote provides a structured yet flexible environment that supports deep engagement with materials and efficient knowledge consolidation.
